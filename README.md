# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK PERFORMED:
I have developed a dynamic weather web page using React.js and a public weather API. The application features a search bar where users can input any location to retrieve real-time weather details. Upon searching, the app dynamically displays key weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant metrics. The frontend is designed to be user-friendly, offering a responsive and visually appealing interface. API integration ensures accurate and up-to-date weather information, while React's state management handles real-time updates efficiently. This project highlights the use of React.js to create an interactive and informative web application.
